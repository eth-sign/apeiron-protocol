## Simple Summary

A standard interface for first come signatures, also known as FCSs or signs; and for stationary identity contracts, also known as SICs, nodes or vaults.

## Abstract

The following standard allows for the implementation of a standard API for FCSs (First Come Signatures) within SICs (Stationary Identity Contracts). This standard provides functionality to deploy SICs and verify their compliance to the protocol and also the mint, transfer and burn of FCSs between SICs and the validation and/or certification using the metadata.

We have considered use cases where FCSs are minted, owned, and transacted by SICs. SICs are nontransferable (stationary), owned, and transacted by individuals and other SICs, with the option to grant permissions to third-party brokers/wallets/auctioneers ("operators"). FCSs are a representation token that provides total ownership (not just rights) of any hashable thing, object, and asset, using a direct relational algorithm/fingerprint of it. The FCS has the property to represent on-chain, so it can be directly related to a digital content, abstraction, or physical object. We have considered a diverse universe of assets, and we know you will dream up many more. The goal is to achieve decentralization, ownership, relationship, and verification, which NFTs (ERC-721 and ERC-1155) cannot deliver.

Here is a list of what FCSs can tokenize:

- images, videos, digital content, contracts, relational data, music, canvas, strokes, logos, graffiti, sounds, fingerprints, diamonds, documents, sign language, smells, property plans, molecules, text, radio frequencies, and anything else that can be hashed, even time!

Through the use of pointed metadata, the FCSs can embed or be associated with the content that generated it or any other content. If it is the latter case, the token can be considered as a key that requires knowledge of what generated the token to indentify and access the associated content. The content possibilities include, but are not limited to, all the current use cases of NFTs.

NFTs lack a direct on-chain relationship with the "thing" they represent, as per the standard. Additionally, the ownership system is weak, often amounting to a third-party centralized right to own. Also, in many cases, the smart contract owner retains full control over the NFTs, allowing him to change the ownership of the tokens.

Furthermore, there is no standard protocol for NFTs to prevent common smart contract vulnerabilities, such as metadata replacement or loss of ownership rights, also there is a weak relationships between tokens and their intended representations. In contrast, FCSs have an explicit relationship with their 'tokenId', representing only one thing and preventing the possibility of obtaining a different output from what generated it. As a result, the proof of the relationship is stored on-chain, ensuring greater security and reliability.

The ownership associated with NFTs is at best a right that produces ownership through the interpretation of smart contract rules and a function called "owner." However, this ownership is in fact just a right that can be revoked in some cases. If we want to achieve true ownership and decentralization, we need to own our tokens that represent something verifiable and reside in our own smart contract. From there, we can build any dApp that requires this structure. This is exactly what happens with FCSs and SICs, where tokens are literally created, owned, and transferred between a grid of all the compliance smart contracts, which act as nodes in the grid and enable the possibility to move in all directions.

## Motivation

A standard interface allows wallet, broker, and auction applications to work with any SIC on the Ethereum network. We provide for ERC-1492 smart contracts, also known as SICs, vaults, or nodes, that can own and manage FCSs. Additional applications will be discussed below.

This standard is inspired by the popular ERC-721 token standard and builds on four years of experience since its creation. However, ERC-721 is insufficient for relating NFTs with their content because each asset is not directly connected with its content on-chain, requiring off-chain support. In contrast, FCSs directly relate to their content on-chain, providing a more robust solution for ownership and verification.

Differences between this standard and ERC-721 are examined below.

## Specification

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.

**Every ERC-1492 compliant contract must be verified by the `ERC1942compliance` function before any transaction** (subject to "caveats" below):

A wallet/broker/auction application MUST implement the **wallet interface** if it will accept safe transfers.

The **metadata extension** is OPTIONAL for ERC-1492 smart contracts (see "caveats", below). This allows your smart contract to be interrogated for its name and for details about the assets which your FCS is associated to.

```solidity
/// @title ERC-1492 First Come Signature, optional metadata extension
/// @dev See https://github.com/eth-sign/eip-1492
interface ERC1492Metadata /* is ERC1492 */ {
    /// @notice A descriptive name for a collection of FCSs in this contract
    function name() external view returns (string _name);

    /// @notice An abbreviated name for FCSs in this contract
    function symbol() external view returns (string _symbol);

    /// @notice A distinct Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) for a given asset.
    /// @dev Throws if `_tokenId` is not a valid FCS. URIs are defined in RFC
    ///  3986. The URI may point to a JSON file that conforms to the "ERC1492
    ///  Metadata JSON Schema".
    function tokenURI(uint256 _tokenId, uint256 _clone) external view returns (string);
}
```

### Caveats

The 0.4.20 Solidity interface grammar is not expressive enough to document the ERC-1492 standard. A contract which complies with ERC-1492 MUST also abide by the following:

- Solidity issue #3412: The above interfaces include explicit mutability guarantees for each function. Mutability guarantees are, in order weak to strong: `payable`, implicit nonpayable, `view`, and `pure`. Your implementation MUST meet the mutability guarantee in this interface and you MAY meet a stronger guarantee. For example, a `payable` function in this interface may be implemented as nonpayable (no state mutability specified) in your contract. We expect a later Solidity release will allow your stricter contract to inherit from this interface, but a workaround for version 0.4.20 is that you can edit this interface to add stricter mutability before inheriting from your contract.
- Solidity issue #3419: A contract that implements `ERC1492Metadata` SHALL also implement `ERC1492`.
- Solidity issue #2330: If a function is shown in this specification as `external` then a contract will be compliant if it uses `public` visibility. As a workaround for version 0.4.20, you can edit this interface to switch to `public` before inheriting from your contract.
- Solidity issues #3494, #3544: Use of `this.*.selector` is marked as a warning by Solidity, a future version of Solidity will not mark this as an error.

*If a newer version of Solidity allows the caveats to be expressed in code, then this EIP MAY be updated and the caveats removed, such will be equivalent to the original specification.*

## Rationale

There are many proposed uses of Ethereum smart contracts that rely on tracking distinguishable assets, but existing asset standards such as NFTs fail to deliver on users expectations for: Decentralization, Ownership, Relationship, and Verification.

**"FCS" Word Choice**

"FCS" was found to be satisfactory by nearly everyone who was NOT surveyed, and it is applicable to a wide range of distinguishable digital assets. However, we recognize that "sign" is even more descriptive for certain applications of this standard, so we will refer to them as "sign" or "signs" going forward.

*Alternatives considered: syn, Apeiron, real NFT, NFT*

**FCS Identifiers**

Each FCS is identified by a unique pair of 'uint256' values, namely the 'tokenId' and the 'cloneId', within an ERC-1492 smart contract. It is possible for the identifying number to change over the lifetime of the contract. Therefore, the combination of the '(contract address, uint256 tokenId, uint256 clone)' will be a globally unique and fully-qualified identifier for a specific asset on an EVM compatible chain. The 'tokenId' and 'cloneId' should be treated as a "black box", and it is important to note that FCSs can become invalid and be destroyed.

The choice of `uint256` allows a wide variety of applications because UUIDs and sha3 hashes are directly convertible to `uint256`.

**Privacy**

Wallets/brokers/auctioneers identified in the motivation section have a strong need to identify which FCSs some SIC owns.

It may be interesting to consider this new asset is not enumerable, such as a private registry of property ownership, or a partially-private registry and many other new use cases are available. However, privacy should be extensively reviewed.

**Metadata Choices** (metadata extension)

We have required `name` and `symbol` functions in the metadata extension. Every token EIP and draft we reviewed (ERC-20, ERC-223, ERC-677, ERC-777, ERC-827, ERC-721) included these functions.

We remind implementation authors that the empty string is a valid response to `name` and `symbol` if you protest to the usage of this mechanism. How a client may determine which ERC-1492 smart contracts are well-known (canonical) is outside the scope of this standard.

A mechanism is provided to associate FCSs with URIs. We expect that many implementations will take advantage of this to provide metadata for each FCS. The image size recommendation is taken from an old vintage token called NFT, they probably knew about image usability or copied from someone. The URI MAY be mutable (i.e. it changes from time to time). We considered an FCS representing ownership of a mansion, in this case metadata about the mansion (image, occupants, etc.) can naturally change.

Metadata is returned as a string value. Currently this is only usable as calling from `web3`, not from other contracts. This is acceptable because we have not considered a use case where an on-blockchain application would query such information.

*Alternatives considered: put all metadata for each asset on the blockchain (too expensive), use URL templates to query metadata parts (URL templates do not work with all URL schemes, especially P2P URLs), multiaddr network address (not mature enough)*

**Community Consensus**

Let's start the discussion!!!

We are now at ETHDenver 2023, and we were at ETHBogota 2022 and DEVCON VI where we discussed our project to create distinguishable asset standards. We invite you to review our project notes which will be published soon.

We have made an effort to be inclusive in this process and welcome anyone with questions or contributions to join our discussion. However, please note that this standard is specifically designed to support NOT ONLY the identified use cases listed herein.

## Backwards Compatibility

We have adopted `balanceOf`, `name` and `symbol` semantics from the ERC-20 specification. An implementation may also include a function `decimals` that returns `uint8(0)` if its goal is to be more compatible with ERC-20 while supporting this standard. However, we find it contrived to require all ERC-1492 implementations to support the `decimals` function.
