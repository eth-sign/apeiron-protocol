## Simple Summary

A standard interface for first come signatures, also known as FCSs or signs; and for stationary identity contracts, also known as SIC or vaults.

## Abstract

The following standard allows for the implementation of a standard API for FCSs (First Come Signatures) within SICs (Stationary Identity Contracts). This standard provides functionality to deploy SICs and verify their compilance to the protocol and also the mint and transfer of FCSs between SICs.

We considered use cases of FCSs being minted, owned and transacted by SICs, while the SICs are nontransferible (stationary) owned and transacted by individuals and other SICs, having the option to grant permssions to third party brokers/wallets/auctioneers ("operators"). FCSs are a representation token that gives total ownership (not just rights) of any hashable thing, object and asset using a direct relational "not algorithm" algotithm of what is it. The FCS has the property to represent, so to be directly related, to a physical or digital content in the blockchain. We considered a diverse universe of assets, and we know you will dream up many more and also do all the things that you can't do now with NFTs.

Here is a list of what an FCSs can tokenize:

- strokes, logos, graffiti, canvas, sounds, sign language, text, smells, radiofrecuencies and anything that can be hashable, even time!

Then, through the pointed metadata the FCSs can embed or be associated to any content, including but not limited to all the current NFTs use cases.

NFTs don't direct represent what it can be associated to on-chain by the standard and also has a weak property system where you might get, as much, a third party centralized right of the ownership, and in many cases, under the smart contract owner total control.

Also as there is not a NFT protocol to avoid many common smart contracts "bad practices" so there is many risks of: NFT metadata change, losing the ownership rights, etc. With FCSs the relation is the ID so it represents just one thing and there is no possibility to missunderstand it, because we are storing the proof of it on-chain as the FCS ID.

Regarding the associated ownership that NFTs gives, in the best case, is a right that produces an ownership through smart contract rules, but if we are talking about real ownership and real decentralization, you must own your tokens that must represent something verificable and reside in your own smart contract to be decentralized, and then build over it. This is what happen with FCSs and SICs, where tokens are literaly owned and transfered between contracts.

## Motivation

A standard interface allows wallet/broker/auction applications to work with any SIC on Ethereum. We provide for ERC-1492 smart contracts (aka SICs) that owns this FCSs. Additional applications are discussed below.

This standard is inspired by the ERC-721 token standard and builds on 4 years of experience since EIP-721 was created. EIP-712 is insufficient for tracking FCSs because each asset is not directly vinculated with it's content onchain (needs off-chain support) whereas the tokens are just references to be processed by a smart contract rule (owned by someone's else contract).

Differences between this standard and EIP-721 are examined below.

## Specification

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.

**Every ERC-1492 compliant contract must be verified by the `ERC1942compliance` function before any transaction** (subject to "caveats" below):

A wallet/broker/auction application MUST implement the **wallet interface** if it will accept safe transfers.

The **metadata extension** is OPTIONAL for ERC-1492 smart contracts (see "caveats", below). This allows your smart contract to be interrogated for its name and for details about the assets which your FCS is associated to.

```solidity
/// @title ERC-1492 First Come Signature, optional metadata extension
/// @dev See https://github.com/eth-sign/eip-1492
interface ERC1492Metadata /* is ERC1492 */ {
    /// @notice A descriptive name for a collection of FCSs in this contract
    function name() external view returns (string _name);

    /// @notice An abbreviated name for FCSs in this contract
    function symbol() external view returns (string _symbol);

    /// @notice A distinct Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) for a given asset.
    /// @dev Throws if `_tokenId` is not a valid fcs. URIs are defined in RFC
    ///  3986. The URI may point to a JSON file that conforms to the "ERC1492
    ///  Metadata JSON Schema".
    function tokenURI(uint256 _tokenId, uint256 _clone) external view returns (string);
}
```

This is the "ERC1492 Metadata JSON Schema" referenced above.

```json
{
    "title": "Asset Metadata",
    "type": "object",
    "properties": {
        "validator_n": {
            "type": "string",
            "description": "A signature of the _tokenId itself by third party 'n' validator that is purposed for implementation validation as a trusted source of information for authenticity or certification. This can be implemented with consensus protocols, open protocols, private rings, centralized protocols, etc."
        }        
        "name": {
            "type": "string",

            "type": "string",
            "description": "Describes the asset to which this FCS represents"

            "type": "string",

        }
    }
}
```

### Caveats

The 0.4.20 Solidity interface grammar is not expressive enough to document the ERC-1492 standard. A contract which complies with ERC-1492 MUST also abide by the following:

- Solidity issue #3412: The above interfaces include explicit mutability guarantees for each function. Mutability guarantees are, in order weak to strong: `payable`, implicit nonpayable, `view`, and `pure`. Your implementation MUST meet the mutability guarantee in this interface and you MAY meet a stronger guarantee. For example, a `payable` function in this interface may be implemented as nonpayable (no state mutability specified) in your contract. We expect a later Solidity release will allow your stricter contract to inherit from this interface, but a workaround for version 0.4.20 is that you can edit this interface to add stricter mutability before inheriting from your contract.
- Solidity issue #3419: A contract that implements `ERC1492Metadata` SHALL also implement `ERC1492`.
- Solidity issue #2330: If a function is shown in this specification as `external` then a contract will be compliant if it uses `public` visibility. As a workaround for version 0.4.20, you can edit this interface to switch to `public` before inheriting from your contract.
- Solidity issues #3494, #3544: Use of `this.*.selector` is marked as a warning by Solidity, a future version of Solidity will not mark this as an error.

*If a newer version of Solidity allows the caveats to be expressed in code, then this EIP MAY be updated and the caveats removed, such will be equivalent to the original specification.*

## Rationale

There are many proposed uses of Ethereum smart contracts that depend on tracking distinguishable assets. But the existing assts like NFTs are not delivering the real promise or expectations from the users.

**"FCS" Word Choice**

"FCS" was satisfactory to nearly everyone NOT surveyed and is widely applicable to a broad universe of distinguishable digital assets. We recognize that "sign" is even more descriptive for certain applications of this standard so we will refer to them as "sign" or "signs".

*Alternatives considered: syn, Apeiron, real NFT*

**FCS Identifiers**

Every FCS is identified by a unique pair `uint256` `token ID` and `uint256` `clone ID` inside an ERC-1492 smart contract. This identifying number MAY change in the life of the contract. The trio `(contract address, uint256 tokenId, uint256 clone)` will then be a globally unique and fully-qualified identifier for a specific asset on an Ethereum chain. We MUST treat the `token ID` and `clone ID` as a "black box". Also note that FCSs MAY become invalid (be destroyed).

The choice of `uint256` allows a wide variety of applications because UUIDs and sha3 hashes are directly convertible to `uint256`.

**Privacy**

Wallets/brokers/auctioneers identified in the motivation section have a strong need to identify which FCSs an owner owns.

It may be interesting to consider this new asset is not enumerable, such as a private registry of property ownership, or a partially-private registry and many other new use cases are available. However, privacy should be extensively reviewed.

**Metadata Choices** (metadata extension)

We have required `name` and `symbol` functions in the metadata extension. Every token EIP and draft we reviewed (ERC-20, ERC-223, ERC-677, ERC-777, ERC-827, ERC-721) included these functions.

We remind implementation authors that the empty string is a valid response to `name` and `symbol` if you protest to the usage of this mechanism. How a client may determine which ERC-1492 smart contracts are well-known (canonical) is outside the scope of this standard.

A mechanism is provided to associate FCSs with URIs. We expect that many implementations will take advantage of this to provide metadata for each FCS. The image size recommendation is taken from an old vintage network called Instagram, they probably knew about image usability. The URI MAY be mutable (i.e. it changes from time to time). We considered an FCS representing ownership of a house, in this case metadata about the house (image, occupants, etc.) can naturally change.

Metadata is returned as a string value. Currently this is only usable as calling from `web3`, not from other contracts. This is acceptable because we have not considered a use case where an on-blockchain application would query such information.

*Alternatives considered: put all metadata for each asset on the blockchain (too expensive), use URL templates to query metadata parts (URL templates do not work with all URL schemes, especially P2P URLs), multiaddr network address (not mature enough)*

**Community Consensus**

Let's start the discussion!!!

We are now in ETHBogota 2022 in our project to discuss distinguishable asset standards (notes to be published).

We have been very inclusive in this process and invite anyone with questions or contributions into our discussion. However, this standard is written only to support the identified use cases which are listed herein.

## Backwards Compatibility

We have adopted `balanceOf`, `totalSupply`, `name` and `symbol` semantics from the ERC-20 specification. An implementation may also include a function `decimals` that returns `uint8(0)` if its goal is to be more compatible with ERC-20 while supporting this standard. However, we find it contrived to require all ERC-1492 implementations to support the `decimals` function.
