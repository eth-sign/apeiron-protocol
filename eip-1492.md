## Simple Summary

A fully decentralized and secure tokenization protocol that ensures complete ownership of our tokens, referred to as 'Signs'. These Signs maintain a direct on-chain correlation with what they represent and can move through the grid formed by all the protocol users. Additionally, each Sign can be authenticated through digital signatures embedded within its metadata.

## Abstract

The following standard allows for the implementation of a standard API for Signs within Consoles (Proxy Smart Contracts) and Cartridges (Execution Smart Contracts). This standard provides functionality to deploy a standard Console and a standard Cartridge (the first Cartridge version IS named 'Pong') which guarantees their full compliance to the EIP-1492 (Apeiron) protocol using EXTCODEHASH whitelists. 

The Console is responsible for creating, storing, and deleting Signs by modifying ONLY their metadata and shielding the integrity of the tokens mapping. Cartridge runs the functions to operate with the Signs and transacts with remote Consoles only by compliance. The Console will mint and burn Signs and modify ONLY the metadata of the Signs, by the Cartridge requests, not being capable to modify other token information at all. The Signs validation/certification happens on the metadata layer and is, in most cases, an off-chain process, unless a user wants to store it fully on-chain, something not relevant at this point.

Diagram of the EIP-1492 Handshake:

                             +-----------+                                   +-----------+ 
                             | Cartridge |                                   | Cartridge |
                             +-----------+                                   +-----------+ 
        User ----- tx -----> | Console 1 | <------ EXTCODEHASH CHECKS -----> | Console 2 |
                             +-----------+                                   +-----------+
                             |   Signs   |                                   |   Signs   |
                             +-----------+                                   +-----------+ 

On the Handshake both Consoles check the EXTCODEHASH of the remote Console and Cartridge. If both (Console and Cartridge) are whitelisted, for both of the Consoles, it proceeds normally with the requested User tx, which can go through or be reverted depending on other circumstantial factors but not depending on the protocol. i.e. an unexpected token pull/push request.

Note that for the EIP-1492 Apeiron compliance, both Consoles smart contracts MUST have identical code (but MUST NOT be the same contract address), but the Cartridge smart contracts address could be the same (not strictly necessary but is the recommendation) since the code MUST be exactly the same for this proposal.

We have considered use cases where Signs are minted, owned, and transacted by Consoles through the Cartridges compliance functionality. Consoles are owned only by individuals and transacted by the owner and other Consoles, with the option to grant permissions to third-party 'operators'. Signs are a representation token that provides total ownership (not just rights) of any hashable or relational thing, object, and asset, using a direct relational algorithm/fingerprint of it, something that MUST be defined by each project information. The Signs have the property to represent anything on-chain, so they can be directly related to digital content, abstraction, or physical object. We have considered a diverse universe of assets, and we know you will dream up many more. The goal is to achieve decentralization, ownership, relationship, and verification, which NFTs (ERC-721 and ERC-1155) cannot deliver, but many other opportunities are coming with this Console/Cartridge architecture.

To accomplish this objective, we need to ensure the origin and credibility of the tokens. Thus, the Consoles provide the users and Cartridges the ability to mint Signs but never alter them, except for the metadata which can change as many times as is needed. This guarantees that the tokens cannot be duplicated or re-minted as the same, not even by the Console owner in the same Proxy Smart Contract Storage.

Let's explore the structure of the EIP-1492 token (Signs) mapping on the Console Storage. This mapping has only the write permission to the Console functions and cannot be directly altered by Cartridges or the smart contract owner.

        +-----------------+--------------+----------------+
        | string tokenId  | uint256 key  | byte metadata  |
        +-----------------+--------------+----------------+

- The 'tokenId' is created alongside the token and remains unchangeable, thereby preserving the token's intended relationship. It can only be removed when the token is burned by the Console function.
- The 'key' is an auto-incrementing value that never decreases, regardless of whether a lower value is deleted. This design prevents token impersonation. It can only be removed when the token is burned.
- The 'metadata' comprises binary code of compressed metadata using the 'brotli' algorithm. Since this computation is always performed off-chain, this will save data and storage tx costs. It can be empty if the user hosts it's own tokens metadata and configured the Cartridge to avoid writting it down in Storage. This can be done by the combination of optional configurations.

Here is a list of what Signs can tokenize:

- images, videos, digital content, contracts, relational data, POAPs, music, books, properties, canvas, strokes, logos, graffiti, sounds, fingerprints, diamonds, documents, sign language, smells, patents, plans, molecules, text, radio frequencies, secret messages and anything else that can be hashed, even time!

Through the use of metadata, the Signs can embed or be associated with the content that generated it or any other content. If it is the latter case, the token can be considered as a key that requires knowledge of what generated it to identify and access the associated content, a secret message. This is later explained in the Metadata section. The content possibilities include, but are not limited to, all the current use cases of NFTs.

NFTs lack a direct on-chain relationship with the "thing" they represent, as per the standard. Additionally, the ownership system is weak, often amounting to a third-party centralized right to own. Also, in many cases, the smart contract owner retains full control over the NFTs, allowing him to change the ownership of the tokens.

Furthermore, there is no standard protocol for NFTs to prevent common smart contract vulnerabilities, such as undesired metadata replacement or loss of ownership rights, also there is a weak relationship between tokens and their intended representations. In contrast, Signs have an explicit relationship with their 'tokenId', representing only one thing and preventing the possibility of obtaining a different output from what generated it. As a result, the proof of the relationship is stored on-chain, ensuring greater security and reliability.

The ownership associated with NFTs is, at best, a right that produces ownership through the interpretation of smart contract rules and a function called "owner." However, this ownership is in fact just a right that can be revoked in some cases. If we want to achieve true ownership and decentralization, we need to own our tokens that represent something verifiable and reside in our own smart contract. From there, we can build any dApp that requires this structure. This is exactly what happens with Signs, Consoles, and Cartridges, where tokens are literally created, owned, and transferred between a grid of all the compliance Consoles and interact with the desired Cartridges, which act as nodes in the grid and enable the possibility to move in all directions and also extend the functionality.

I know that probably many developers are wondering now "How can I mint a 10,000 tokens collection with this shielded standard that allows 1 by 1 mint and needs to use a lot of txs (and so time and gas) for it?", a task that is straightforward with NFTs. I understand that this will be a main issue in the mass adoption problems, so I would love if the community helps to build a very simple standard Cartridge to create an easy 'N tokens Collection mint' without many options on the contract, as happens with 69 of every 420 NFT space collections. Well, you will find a standard interface suggestion for this in the 'Community Consensus' section.

ould love if the community decides to name this 'N tokens Collection mint' as 'Asteroids'. Given the differing EXTCODEHASH this can be implemented with the standard from scratch as well, to avoid each user need to whitelist the 'Asteroids' Cartridge, something that naturally needs also the mandatory community audits and opens the space for scams very fast. By doing this the users can enjoy the new possibilities that this Cartridge would bring without taking a risk, making the flow from NFTs to Consoles soft.

Many security and critical considerations are taken and listed in the sections, such as the capability of block incomming tokens, time-lock owner-changes and storage collisions.

## Motivation

A standard interface facilitates wallets, brokers, social, gaming, and marketplace dApps to interact seamlessly and with confidence with any Console on the Ethereum network grid. This is particularly provided for ERC-1492 smart contracts, otherwise known as Consoles, vaults, or nodes of the grid, that are capable of owning and managing Signs through compliance Cartridges. Further applications will be explored in the following sections.

This EIP-1492 Apeiron token standard builds upon the well-known ERC-721 token standard, drawing from four years of collective experience since its introduction. However, ERC-721 design has inherent centralization, security shortcomings, and an insufficient framework for correlating tokens with their intended representations. This is primarily due to the lack of direct on-chain connection or relationship between each asset and its representation, thus requiring off-chain information for this purpose. In stark contrast, Signs are fully decentralized, and secure, and provide complete ownership to the Console owner. They are also directly connected to their representation on-chain, thereby offering a more robust and reliable solution for asset ownership and verification.

A wallet/broker/auction application MUST implement the **wallet interface** if it will accept safe transfers.

The **metadata extension** is OPTIONAL for ERC-1492 smart contracts (see "caveats", below). This allows your smart contract to be interrogated for its name and for details about the assets which your Signs is associated to.

### Caveats

This pre-draft is derived from the ERC-721 proposal as 'template'. As such, this section of this document might appear to be out of context or incomplete. We acknowledge these potential inconsistencies and are actively learning and working towards refining this draft.

## Rationale

There are many proposed uses of Ethereum smart contracts that rely on tracking distinguishable assets, but existing asset standards such as NFTs fail to deliver on users expectations for: Decentralization, Ownership, Relationship, and Verification.

**"Consoles" and "Cartridges" Word Choice**

The Proxy smart contract is responsible for creating, securing, and storing tokens, based on requests from the Execution smart contract, which operates under a specific, changeable configuration. The Proxy consistently ensures protocol compliance from all counterparties, working solely under the agreed-upon standard. This is achieved by maintaining checks with remote Proxies and Execution smart contracts in every transaction. It is anticipated that the community of developers will create a variety of Execution smart contracts, offering diverse use cases and promoting widespread adoption of their protocol implementation. That's why we've dubbed the Proxy smart contracts 'Consoles' and the Execution smart contracts 'Cartridges'. Future versions of both can emerge, always striving to maximize potential while safeguarding the redundancy and security of the token Storage.

**"Signs" Word Choice**

'Signs' is a reference to 'signature', inspired by one of the primary features of EIP-1492 tokens: their relationship with the entity they originate from. This term found wide acceptance among virtually everyone who was NOT surveyed, and is applicable to an extensive range of distinguishable digital assets. Previously, we used a different name, FCS (First Come Signature), due to its relevance in the context of social networks, something that originated and inspired us to build this standard. However, we ultimately decided that 'sign' is more descriptive for most applications of this standard. Therefore, we will refer to these as 'sign' or 'signs' moving forward. (and back!).

*Alternatives considered: FCS, syn, Apeiron (now is the Protocol name), real NFT, NFT*

**Sign Identifiers**

Each Sign is identified by a unique pair of 'string' and 'uint256 auto-incremental' values, namely the 'tokenId' and the 'key' respectively, within an ERC-1492 smart contract address in a specific chain. It is NOT possible for the identifiers to change over the lifetime of the contract once are mapped, except on the deletion. Therefore, the combination of the '(contract address, string tokenId, uint256 key, chain)' will be a globally unique and fully-qualified identifier for a specific asset on an EVM compatible chain. The 'tokenId' and 'key' should be treated as a "black box", and it is important to note that Signs can be destroyed/deleted by the functions included in the first standard EIP-1492 Cartridge, called "Pong". This happens because of a transfer or on a Console owner request.

The choice of `string` for the tokenId allows a wide variety of representation applications, that in conjuntion with the metadata implementation will bring infinite possibilities to the developers.

**Privacy**

This pre-draft is derived from the ERC-721 proposal as 'template'. As such, this section of this document might appear to be out of context or incomplete. We acknowledge these potential inconsistencies and are actively learning and working towards refining this draft.

**Security**

We have analyzed many potential threats to the protocol, and we know there is more. Here is a list of the detected ones and the solution implemented.

- Proxy Smart Contract administration and functions
We explored various alternatives, including the Transparent Proxy by OpenZeppelin. However, this excellent solution wasn't practical for EIP-1492 since the contract administrator would need continuous interaction with it. Therefore, our resolution involved defining an admin function for the Proxy smart contract and securing it, adding 'EIP-1967: Proxy Storage Slots' policies to prevent Storage collisions. It's crucial to never accept a Cartridge as compliant if it contains functions that conflict with the Console functions, based on the first four bytes of the function selector. If such a conflict occurs, the Cartridge functions selectors must be modified. Also the fallback functions should be dissabled.
At one point we contemplated utilizing Libraries instead of Execution smart contracts for the Cartridges. However, we concluded that not only does this approach make rapid development more challenging, but Libraries also pose a significant risk to the integrity of the Proxy smart contract tokens mapping. This integrity is paramount, and Libraries could potentially manipulate functions in unforeseen ways.

- Protocol Compliance
By the EXTCODEHASH revision we ensure, in the local Proxy smart contract (Console), that the code of the remote Console is as expected. Initially, and until protocol updates occur, this will remain the same, but there could be versions in the future. Therefore, this guarantees that in addition to ensuring safe storage management and preserving the integrity of the tokens, there isn't a function that obscures or tries to overwrite the value of the function where the Execution contract (Cartridge) is defined in the Console. Thus, we can confidently state that by reading the remote value of this variable, we will obtain the address of the Execution smart contract that the remote Proxy is using, and we can continue with the compliance review of it (Cartridge).
When the first check is completed and positive, we proceed to verify the EXTCODEHASH of the remote Execution contract (Cartridge). If it's a Cartridge we want to interact with, by matching it against the whitelist where initially there is only one, we procceed, but if it's not on the whitelist, the transaction will be reverted. This is what we call "the grid" where the tokens can freely move: All the compliance Consoles/Cartridges, and you can go in and out of the grid, or move between them, as your will.
It is not recommended to change these values or add EXTCODEHASH to the whitelists of Consoles or Cartridges unless we clearly understand what we are doing. This can potentially lead to theft and/or deletion of our tokens, involvement in the sending or production of unwanted or counterfeit tokens, substitution of metadata, or even total loss of our Console and therefore all tokens contained within it
It's important to note that, thanks to the possible redundancy added between the tokenId and metadata (in addition to ownership data, smart contracts, and chains), it's likely that many (or perhaps all) stolen tokens or the contract in its entirety could lose all on-chain/off-chain value when an attack occurs. These could potentially be regenerated, possibly with the help of Validators who signed the metadata, if they used more variables than the tokenId, and some effort from the victim to process the recoveries. Ultimately, this could restore all their value, leaving the stolen ones worthless, without the need to create blacklists, request help from uninvolved third parties, and thanks to the simple compliance that the protocol in general suggests.

- Token Redundancy
The token mapping is stored in the Console and is handled by 3 simple functions in the Console, accesible ONLY by the owner and the Cartridge. The tokenId and key value can't be modified after creation by anyone, including the own Console. The tokens can be deleted, just for remove them or when a transfer occurs. The metadata can be changed and updated as many times the user wants. With this concept we guarantee that there will be never a false token around, since the 'tokenId'+'key'+'contract_address'+'chain' can't never be duplicated, so the metadata will guarantee this for never happening.

- Token Security
User can choose with wich trusted Consoles (smart contract addresses) want's to interact. Not only because of the protocol protection that is guaranteed, but because he may be interested in only accept interaction with some developers, enterprises or at his will.

- SPAM
At contract level the owner_change proceess involves a push function (can be pulled) so the contract owner should add to a mapping the future contract owner address, then the counterpart should initialize the function and change the current contract owner to his address. At tokens level users can choose to block all incomming transaction (except whitelisted) so his contract will not accept any token by push requests.

**Optimization**

- Smart Contract constructors 'Parent' > 'Child.
To make it extremely simple for the users and mass adoption a Constructor will be available to deploy the Consoles with one transaction, then initializing and other 'new deployed contracts exploits' issues are also considered to avoid hacks in the deployment dApp or smart contract code, this needs revision. The Smart Contract will be deployed with the recommended configuration values, unless the user (expert mode) configures others, that can be changed later. Hackers will be ready to exploit them ASAP a new contract is deployed!

- Unique Cartridges
Everyone is free to deploy their compliance Cartridge/s but the recommendation is to use the ones that are already deployed since this will be exactly the same and will avoid you to pay deployment gas. There will be no difference between using the deployed one or a new deployment by the user since 'Pong' Cartridge (the first one) will not have any Storage. 
Note that other Cartridges can need specific user Storage, such as a minting one ('Asteroids') so this could requiere a new deployment (to be considered, not decided yet). Other situation will happen with Enterprise or community Cartridges, and they will decide if the their Cartridges (new EXTCODEHASHs) needs an extra data storage or their specific mapping requirements, so they can consider to push users to deploy it or not, depending their architecture, many ways to do this but is not our task to give the options here now.

- Optional Binary Compressed metadata with 'brotli'
In our mission to 'save gas', we found it interesting to explore a compression (not encryption) algorithm for TEXT inputs. Given the widespread adoption of base64 encoding for metadata with no reported issues, using 'brotli' not only aids in storage optimization but also allows us to change the metadata field to byte, which is more cost-effective to manage.
Given that a dApp or front end always processes metadata, using 'brotli' presents no more difficulty than decoding base64 text. We have considered potential challenges of this when metadata needs to be processed on-chain, although this is a situation that rarely occurs. If our understanding on this matter proves incorrect, we can revert this 'optimization'.
Furthermore, Console owners can choose whether or not to store the metadata of the tokens, leaving the 'metadata' at no value for the tokens. If the user chooses not to store the metadata, when a metadata request is made, the Console function will use the configured 'baseURI' and reconstruct the metadata URI for the given token as specified above in the 'interface'. This feature is intended for advanced users who opt to host their own metadata (we refer to it as web3 responsibility!)

- EXTCODEHASH Checks
There are other, more 'complex' and expensive yet 'easy to implement' options that we have decided to discard. One such option is a mapping in the Parent smart contract that stores each Console creation. However, after conducting a risk analysis, we discovered numerous potential exploits within our architecture. As a result, we concluded that the only way to be 100% sure of the party we are transacting with is by reviewing the EXTCODEHASH of the provided contract address and on this we set the Compliance requirement, which also happens to be a cost-effective transaction.
We urge caution when adding an EXTCODEHASH to the Console and Cartridges whitelists, as these actions require extensive audits and carry inherent risks. Each user must assume responsibility for these actions.

**Metadata Choices** (metadata extension)

A mechanism is provided to associate Signs with URIs. We expect that many implementations will take advantage of this to provide metadata for each Sign. The URI MAY be mutable (i.e. it changes from time to time). We considered a Sign representing ownership of a mansion, in this case metadata about the mansion (image, occupants, etc.) can naturally change.

The metadata is stored and returned as a byte value, compressed using 'brotli' algorithm, in the order to save gas on every transaction because the less use of transactional data and/or storage. Other tokens, like NFTs, stores the metadata using a string value: 'text plain' or 'base64' (even worst). Since this information is mainly used off-chain from the `web3` by dApps, NOT from other contracts, we find this change accurrate because we have not considered a use case where an on-chain application would query such information and need to use a decompress and decodification on a node, something that whould be very expensive.

The metadata URI will either be generated by the Console when the owner uploads their token metadata to their own storage, or it will be directly transferred from the Storage for each individual token in cases where the former is not applicable.
